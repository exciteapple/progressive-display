# Progressive Display #

A proof of concept that images can be displayed progressively. We start by only sending the most significant bit (MSB), which contains the most information. Then we progressively send the next most significant bits in order to load the image progressively.

The result is that the image is loaded progressively in 8 iterations since there are 8 bits to a byte. In each iteration 4 bits are sent per pixel (R, G, B, A). Hence a low quality image can be sent in an eighth of the original size of the image which is enhanced by further iterations.

## Demo ##

Go to the [releases folder](https://github.com/aaditmshah/progressive-display/releases) and download the latest release of this proof of concept. Extract the files and then open `index.html` in your web browser. Use the select menu to choose the number of bits per component sent (i.e. the progress level).
